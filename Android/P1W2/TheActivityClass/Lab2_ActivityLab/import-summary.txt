ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* ActivityLifecycleWalkthrough.pdf
* ActivityNoReconfig.mp4
* ActivityReconfig.mp4
* Lab-Activity.pdf
* Test1_StartActivityOneTest.txt
* Test2_DoubleRotateActivityOneTest.txt
* Test3_StartActivityTwoTest.txt
* Test4_DoubleRotateActivityTwoTest.txt
* Test5_CloseActivityTwoTest.txt
* Test6_ReopenActivityTwoTest.txt
* ic_launcher-web.png
* proguard-project.txt
* warmupSolution.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => Lab2_ActivityLab\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* res\ => Lab2_ActivityLab\src\main\res\
* src\ => Lab2_ActivityLab\src\main\java\
* Test\libs\robotium-solo-5.3.1.jar => Lab2_ActivityLab\libs\robotium-solo-5.3.1.jar
* Test\res\ => Lab2_ActivityLab\src\androidTest\res\
* Test\src\ => Lab2_ActivityLab\src\androidTest\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
